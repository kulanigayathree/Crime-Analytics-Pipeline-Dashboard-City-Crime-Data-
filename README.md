# Crime Analytics Pipeline Dashboard City Crime Data (Working on)

## Project overview (goal)

Build an end-to-end pipeline that fetches global/city crime data, cleans & transforms it, stores it in a database, and powers an interactive dashboard showing:

- Most dangerous cities (by per-capita rates and absolute counts)
- Crime heatmaps / interactive maps
- Monthly crime trends & seasonality
- Category-wise stats (assault, theft, violent, property, etc.)
- (Add-on) Predictive hotspots (next-month risk) and interactive map with predicted risk
